# Object Oriented Programming

My solution proposals for
the [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#object-oriented-programming)
exercises.

freeCodeCamp module description:
> *"OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do. In this course, you'll learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the this keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance."*

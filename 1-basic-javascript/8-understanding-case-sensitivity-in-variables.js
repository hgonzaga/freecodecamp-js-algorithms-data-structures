/*
Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables:
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

- studlyCapVar should be defined and have a value of 10.
- properCamelCase should be defined and have a value of the string A String.
- titleCaseOver should be defined and have a value of 9000.
- studlyCapVar should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
- properCamelCase should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
- titleCaseOver should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;

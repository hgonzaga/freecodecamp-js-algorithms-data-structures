Passing Values to Functions with Arguments:
1. Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
2. Call the function with two numbers as arguments.

- functionWithArgs should be a function.
- functionWithArgs(1,2) should output 3.
- functionWithArgs(7,9) should output 16.
- You should call functionWithArgs with two numbers after you define it.

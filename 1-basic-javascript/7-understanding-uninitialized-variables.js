/*
Understanding Uninitialized Variables:
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

- a should be defined and evaluated to have the value of 6.
- b should be defined and evaluated to have the value of 15.
- c should not contain undefined and should have a value of the string I am a String!
- You should not change code below the specified comment.

// only changed code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// only changed code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

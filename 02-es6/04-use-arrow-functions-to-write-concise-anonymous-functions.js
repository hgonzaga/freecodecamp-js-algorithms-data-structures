/*
Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions:
Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax.
Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.

- You should replace the var keyword.
- magic should be a constant variable (by using const).
- magic should be a function.
- magic() should return the correct date.
- The function keyword should not be used.

const magic = () => new Date();

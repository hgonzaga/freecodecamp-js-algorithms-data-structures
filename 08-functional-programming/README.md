# Functional Programming

My solution proposals for
the [Functional Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#functional-programming)
exercises.

freeCodeCamp module description:
> *"Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs. In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter()."*

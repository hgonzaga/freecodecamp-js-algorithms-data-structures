/*
Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword:
Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const.
Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant.
Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.

- var should not exist in your code.
- You should change fCC to all uppercase.
- FCC should be a constant variable declared with const.
- fact should be declared with let.
- console.log should be changed to print the FCC and fact variables.

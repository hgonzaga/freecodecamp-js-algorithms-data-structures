/*
Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range:
Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's
greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

- The lowest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your minimum number, myMin.
- The highest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your maximum number, myMax.
- The random number generated by randomRange should be an integer, not a decimal.
- randomRange should use both myMax and myMin, and return a random number in your range.
